			Person Centered Therapy:
		</b></td>
		<td width="25%">
			Carl Rogers was a <b>humanistic</b> psychologist, meaning that he focused on studying the whole person. Rogers developed the idea of person centered therapy (also known as <b>client-centered therapy</b>. Humanistic psychologists refer to those in therapy as 'clients' rather than 'patients' because they see clients as equals. This is because they believe that a growth-promoting climate requires <b>genuineness</b>, <b>acceptance</b>, and <b>empathy</b>. Rogers also coined the term <b>unconditional positive regard</b>, an attitude of total acceptance towards another person.
		</td>

	<tr>
		<td><b>
			Self-Concept: 
		</b></td>
		<td width="75%">
			Maslow and Rogers both focused on the importance of a person's <b>self-concept</b> and how it influences personality. A person's self-concept is all the thoughts and feelings they have in response to the question, “Who am I?” If a person's self-concept is positive, they tend to perceive the world positively. If it is negative, a person will short of their ideal self, and will consequently feel dissatisfied and unhappy.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>
			Assessing the Self: 
		</b></td>
		<td width="75%">
			Rogers created a unique way to assess the personality. This involved a client filling out a questionnaire that asked them to describe their <b>ideal self</b> and their <b>actual self</b>. When the ideal self is similar to the actual self, a person's self-concept is positive. Therefore, one of the goals of Roger's client-centered therapy is to close the gap between the ideal and actual self.

		<td><b>
			Individualism:
		</b></td>
		<td width="25%">
		Critics contend that solely focusing on being true to oneself and fulfilling oneself can lead to overindulgence, selfishness, and moral degradation. Critics believe that patients who focus beyond themselves will receive more social support and be happier. Rogers replied to this by saying the first step to loving others is loving oneself.

			Albert Bandura is the father of the <b>social learning theory</b>, which states behavior is learned from the environment through the process of observational learning. He believes that humans actively process the relationship between their behavior and its consequences and that observational learning could not occur unless cognitive processes were at work.

		<td><b>
			Social-Cognitive Perspective: 
		</b></td>
		<td width="25%">
		Albert Bandura proposed the social-cognitive perspective on personality which emphasises the interaction of people and their situations – similar to the relationship between nature and nurture. The social-cognitive perspective contents that behaviors are formed through conditioning or observing and modeling (hence social). The social cognitive perspective also emphasises that how we cognitively think about our situations also affects our behavior (hence cognitive). Rather than focusing solely on the environment as behaviorists do, social-cognitive psychologists focus on the interaction between person and environment. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>
			Observational Learning: 
		</b></td>
		<td width="75%">
			Albert Bandura believed that observational learning, especially in higher-level animals (such as humans), requires active cognition. Cognition comes into play in the context of <b>modeling</b>, the process of observing and imitating a specific behavior. Bandura pioneered the study of observational learning with his <b>Bobo Doll Experiment</b>. The Bobo Doll experiment was Bandura's famous study concerning aggression. He set up a scenario where infants would observe adults being nice to an inflatable doll, or being aggressive towards it. When the adults left the room, the infants mirrored the behavior they had observed (i. e. infants who observed the aggressive actions were aggressive themselves). Bandura’s studies and modern mirror-neuron research points to the conclusion that learning occurs by observation, imitation, and learning.

	<tr>
		<td><b>
			Reciprocal Determinism: 
		</b></td>
		<td width="75%">
		Albert Bandura also coined the term reciprocal determinism to describe the interaction between a person and environmental factors. Bandura believed that our personality is shaped by the interaction between three key factors: internal cognition, environmental influence, and learned behaviors. Bandura calls this reciprocal determinism because all three factors feed off of eachother. For example, a person chooses his or her environment based on internally recognized predispositions. Then, the chosen environment in turn shapes behavior.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>
			Self Efficacy: 
		</b></td>
		<td width="75%">
		Albert Bandura also believed that a person’s sense of self-efficacy also influences behavior. Bandura defined self-efficacy as the belief one has that he/she will succeed in a particular situation. Because of this, people with a strong sense of self-efficacy will attempt and work at challenge tasks whereas people with a weak sense of self-efficacy will avoid challenging tasks.

		<td><b>
			Operant Conditioning: 
		</b></td>
		<td width="25%">
		B.F. Skinner took Ian Pavlov's work of <b>classical conditioning</b> to a new level. He did this with his work of <b>operant conditioning</b>. Operant conditioning is different from classical conditioning because, rather than organisms associating stimuli in classical conditioning, operant conditioning involves strengthening behavior through reinforcement. During his early studies with rats, Skinner designed an <b>operant chamber</b> – a box that administers a reward from a dispenser when an animal pecks at or presses a trigger. Skinner used shaping in his experiments to gradually guide an animal’s action toward a desired behavior.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>
			Reinforcement: 
		</b></td>
		<td width="75%">
			In his studies, Skinner used both <b>positive reinforcement</b> and <b>negative reinforcement</b>. A <b>reinforcer</b> is an event that strengthens a behavior. Positive reinforcement is the process of adding a desirable stimuli, while negative reinforcement is the process of removing an aversive stimuli. These both increase the desired behavior. However, <b>punishment</b> is also used in operant conditioning. Punishment decreases behavior. <b>Positive punishment</b> is the addition of an aversive stimulus while <b>negative punishment</b> involves withdrawing a desirable stimulus. Finally, Skinner's work also lead to the coining of <b>primary reinforcers</b> and <b>secondary reinforcers</b>. Primary reinforcers are innately reinforcing stimuli such as food, water, or anything else that serves a biological need. Secondary enforcers, on the other hand, are reinforcers that organisms associate with a primary reinforcer. In Skinner's famous experiments, an example of a secondary reinforcer was the green light that flashed before food was administered.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>
			Reinforcement Schedules 
		</b></td>
		<td width="75%">
		Skinner's work also influenced the evolution of <b>reinforcement schedules</b>. Skinner primarily used <b>continuous reinforcement</b> by reinforcing the desired response every time it occurs. However, delayed reinforcers and reinforcement schedules can be used to produce different operant conditioning results. For example, Skinner also used <b>partial (intermittent) reinforcement</b> schedules during his experiment with laboratory pigeons. He used four types of intermittent reinforcement, where responses are sometimes reinforced, sometimes not. These four were: fixed ratio, variable ratio, fixed interval, and variable interval. <b>Fixed ratio</b> reinforcement is the process of reinforcing after a specified number of responses. <b>Variable ratio schedule</b> is the process of reinforcing after an unpredictable number of responses. Ratio schedules are different from interval schedules because interval schedules occur after a set amount of time, not a set number of responses. <b>Variable interval schedule</b> reinforces after an unpredictable amount of time, and <b>fixed interval schedule</b> reinforces after a random amount of time.
